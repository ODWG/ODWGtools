- title: Data Flagging
  desc: >
    A variety of outlier and anomaly detection functions are described
    below. Additional functions for aggregating the results of anomaly
    detection tests, and aggregating data quality flags, are also
    provided.

  - aggregate_tests()

- subtitle: Outlier detection
  desc: >
    All outlier detection functions follow a similar template of inputs
    and outputs. All outlier detection functions accept the following 
    arguments:

    1. a vector of data values;
    2. a logical "mask" used to restrict the calculation of certain
      parameters to a subset of the data; and
    3. A specification of thresholds that discriminate between 
        non-outliers, "mild" outliers, and "extreme" outliers.
    
    All functions return an ordered factor tagging each data value
    as a non-outlier (1), a mild outlier (2), or an extreme outlier (3).
    Some outlier detection functions can alternatively return the actual
    test statistic or score used to classify the data by specifying the
    argument `return.score = TRUE`.

- subtitle: Real-time quality control
  desc: >
    All real-time quality control functions accept a vector of data
    values, and may additionally require parameters such as
    
    - A set of "user thresholds" defining some expected behavior based
      on expert judgment.
    - A set of "sensor thresholds" defining some expected behavior based
      on sensor design or manufacturer guidelines.
    - Test-specific parameters.
    
    All functions return an ordered factor tagging each data value
    as "pass" (1), "suspect" (2), or "fail" (3). Note that not
    all tests are capable of producing any of the three outcomes;
    for example, the "gap test" only returns "pass" or "fail" flags,
    and the "rate of change test" only returns "pass" or "suspect" flags.

    Functions for filling data gaps, e.g., via linear interpolation or
    time-series modeling, are provided.
