This vignette describes functions available for outlier detection,
i.e., the detection of data values outside some specification based
on the statistical or structural distribution of values.

## General structure and output

All outlier detection functions follow a similar template of inputs
and outputs. All outlier detection functions accept the following 
arguments:

 1. a vector of data values;
 2. a logical "mask" used to restrict the calculation of certain
   parameters to a subset of the data; and
 3. A specification of thresholds that discriminate between 
    non-outliers, "mild" outliers, and "extreme" outliers.

All functions return an ordered factor tagging each data value
as a non-outlier (1), a mild outlier (2), or an extreme outlier (3).
Some outlier detection functions can alternatively return the actual
test statistic or score used to classify the data by specifying the
argument `return.score = TRUE`.

## Parametric approaches

`ODWGtools` provides the following functions for parametric
(distribution-based) outlier detection:

 - `tscore_outliers()`: outlier detection based on the one-sample
   t-test. Note that for sample sizes greater than 30, the t-test
   (t-distribution) approach is equivalent to the z-score 
   (normal distribution) approach.
 - `chisq_outliers()`: outlier detection based on the $\Chi^2$
   distribution.

## Non-parametric approaches

`ODWGtools` provides the following functions for non-parametric
(quantile-based) outlier detection:
 
 - `tukey_outliers()`: Tukey's test for outliers (interquartile range).
 - `mad_outliers()`: Outlier detection based on median absolute
   deviation (MAD).

## Other approaches

`ODWGtools` provides the following additional functions 
for outlier detection:
 
 - `lof_outliers()`: Local Outlier Factor (LOF) test for outliers.
 - `iforest_outliers()`: outlier detection based on Isolation Forests.
